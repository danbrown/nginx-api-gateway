## üìù Notes

By default the `site/` directory gets deployed as a static site. This can be modified by changing the `Dockerfile`.

This is deployed using the default NGINX configuration, can be overridden with a custom conf file by adding:

```
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

to the end of the Dockerfile. For more information, [read the docs](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx).
